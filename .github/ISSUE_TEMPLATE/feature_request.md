Vignettes are designed to be more interactive with code, plots, downloadable examples etc. and are written using Quarto. When you make the issue, providing as many of those as possible would help us expedite adding the vignette to the website. For a great example, please see the vignette on [the Richards curve](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/ss3-website/qmds/richards_growth_curve.html). Additionally, if possible, we encourage you to create a pull request with what you would like added.

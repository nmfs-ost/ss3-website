    "text": "Introduction\nStock Synthesis (SS3) is an age- and size-structured stock assessment model in the class of models termed integrated analysis. Stock Synthesis has evolved over time to be able to model a wide range of fish population dynamics and somatic growth and to utilize diverse types of data. The model is coded in C++ with parameter estimation enabled by automatic differentiation though AD Model Builder ADMB.\nSS3 is made up of\n\nA population sub-model that simulates the following population processes:\n\nbiology (growth, maturity, fecundity),\nrecruitment,\nmovement,\nfishery selectivity\nnatural and fishing mortality, and\nresponsiveness to environmental and predation factors.\n\nAn observation sub-model that estimates expected values for various types of data.\nA statistical sub-model that characterizes the data’s goodness of fit and obtains best-fitting parameters with associated variance.\nA forecast sub-model that projects management quantities.\n\nThere are 100+ stocks in the US and throughout the world that use SS3 for which we have provided many national, international, and web-based trainings on SS3. Additionally, we have a very active user-base that contributes heavily to SS3 and the associated R packages as well as participating in the online discussions and forums."

These functions include downloading the executable, changing model input, running the model, and creating an assortment of plots and tables. More information about using {r4ss} is available in the “Introduction to r4ss” vignette. Furthermore, you can navigate to these example plots that were created using {r4ss} for the Big Skate model, which can be found in the ss3-test-models repository.\n\n\nUser Example Models\nWe maintain a GitHub repository of example stock synthesis models for users. Information on what the key features of the user example models are and how to download them can be found in the SS3 user examples repository."

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\n\nRange of permissible \\(b\\) values\nThe Schnute parametrization of the Richards curve used in Stock Synthesis can produce a wide variety of shapes, based on the value of the \\(b\\) parameter, as demonstrated in Section 3.3. When \\(A_1\\) is greater than the youngest age in the model, some combinations of Richards growth parameters can lead to undefined (NaN) predicted length for the younger ages. The choice of \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) will affect the possible growth curve shapes.\nThe one value of \\(b\\) that is not allowed when using the Richards growth curve in Stock Synthesis is \\(b\\!=\\!0\\). This also holds for the R functions ss3_code() and schnute() used in this vignette. When estimating \\(b\\) as a floating-point number, there is effectively no risk of the parameter becoming precisely zero during estimation, as long as the initial value is non-zero. To use a Gompertz growth curve, the \\(b\\) parameter can be fixed at a small value such as 0.0001, as demonstrated in Section 3.2.\n\n\nProof of ss3_code() being equivalent to schnute()\nThe above demonstrations comparing the Stock Synthesis output, ss3_code() and schnute() indicate that they are mathematically equivalent, meaning that the same parameter input produces the same growth curve. The equivalence can also be proven algebraically.\nIn Stock Synthesis, the Richards growth curve is implemented as\n\nss3_code &lt;- function(t, L1, L2, k, b, A1, A2)\n{\n  LminR &lt;- L1^b\n  LmaxR &lt;- L2^b\n  LinfR &lt;- LminR + (LmaxR - LminR) / (1 - exp(-k*(A2-A1)))\n  temp &lt;- LinfR + (LminR - LinfR) * exp(-k*(t-A1))\n  temp^(1/b)\n}\n\n\\[\nL_t ~=~ \\Big[\\,L_{\\infty R} \\;+\\; (L_1^b-L_{\\infty R})\\,\n         e^{-k(t-A_1)}\\,\\Big]^{1/b}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\[L_{\\infty R} ~=~ L_1^b \\;+\\; \\frac{L_2^b\\,-\\,L_1^b}{1-e^{-k(A_2-A_1)}}\\]\nWe proceed by replacing \\(L_{\\infty R}\\) with its definition and then gradually simplify the equation:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nL_t &=& \\bigg[\\,L_1^b \\;+\\; \\frac{L_2^b-L_1^b}{1-e^{-k(A_2-A_1)}} \\;+\\;\n         \\left(L_1^b\\,-\\,\\Big[L_1^b \\,+\\,\n         \\frac{L_2^b-L_1^b}{1-e^{-k(A_2-A_1)}}\\Big]\\right)\n         e^{-k(t-A_1)}\\,\\bigg]^{1/b}\\\\[4ex]\nL_t &=& \\bigg[\\,L_1^b \\;+\\; \\frac{L_2^b-L_1^b}{1-e^{-k(A_2-A_1)}} \\;+\\;\n         \\left(L_1^b\\,-\\, L_1^b \\,-\\, \\frac{L_2^b-L_1^b}{1-e^{-k(A_2-A_1)}}\n         \\right) e^{-k(t-A_1)}\\,\\bigg]^{1/b}\\\\[4ex]\nL_t &=& \\bigg[\\,L_1^b \\;+\\; \\frac{L_2^b-L_1^b}{1-e^{-k(A_2-A_1)}} \\;-\\;\n         \\frac{L_2^b-L_1^b}{1-e^{-k(A_2-A_1)}}\\, e^{-k(t-A_1)}\\,\\bigg]^{1/b}\\\\[4ex]\nL_t &=& \\bigg[\\,L_1^b \\;+\\; (L_2^b-L_1^b)\\,\\frac{1}{1-e^{-k(A_2-A_1)}} \\;-\\;\n         (L_2^b-L_1^b)\\,\\frac{e^{-k(t-A_1)}}{1-e^{-k(A_2-A_1)}}\\,\\bigg]^{1/b}\\\\[4ex]\nL_t &=& \\left[\\:L_1^b\\;+\\;(L_2^b-L_1^b)\\,\n         \\frac{1-e^{-k(t-A_1)}}{1-e^{-k(A_2-A_1)}}\\,\\right]^{1/b}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\nschnute &lt;- function(t, L1, L2, k, b, A1, A2)\n{\n  (L1^b + (L2^b-L1^b) * (1-exp(-k*(t-A1))) / (1-exp(-k*(A2-A1))))^(1/b)\n}\n\n\n\nFSA package\nThe FSA package on CRAN (Ogle et al. 2023) is a useful reference to navigate through the plethora of alternative parametrizations of different growth curves. Among the FSA function calls that are relevant to this vignette are:\n\nlibrary(FSA)\nSchnute(t, case=1, ...)\nSchnute(t, case=2, ...)\n\nSchnute case 1 (Schnute 1981, Eq. 15) is the same as schnute() used in this vignette.\nSchnute case 2 (Schnute 1981, Eq. 16) is a Gompertz growth model parametrized with \\(L_1\\), \\(L_2\\), and \\(k\\), similar to ss3_code() and schnute() when \\(b\\) is fixed at nearly 0."

First estimate the parameter that determines scale in an SS3 model (\\(R_{0}\\) - expected recruitment in an unfished state) in phase 1 and then refine the model fit by adding parameters.\nThe parameters are added at each phase so, for example, the parameters that are estimated in phase 3 are those estimated in phase 2 plus those designated as to be estimated in phase 3.\nThe phasing sequence should not matter but (a) good phasing can speed things up, (b) bad phasing can lead to the estimation being trapped in a local minimum, and (c) jittering™ can help to assess how reliable the final estimates are.\nThe schema below is based on eight phases but, sometimes I will “skip a phase”, e.g. place the other “annual deviations” in phase 9 rather than phase 8 (And estimate no “new” parameters in phase 8) to allow the estimation method to better characterize the parameters estimated in phases 1-7.\nHowever, many models don’t go beyond 5 phases and generally people don’t advise going beyond 10 phases.\n\nAndré’s preferred order:\n\nStart with an “Age-structured Production Model”, estimating \\(R_{0}\\) and catchability, Q.\nAdd recruitment deviations (as these can pick up signals from the age and length data on cohort size) (at this point your model is analogous to JABBA)\nNow estimate the base selectivity [and retention] parameters (enabling this to be refined)\nNow estimate growth\nNow estimate natural mortality, \\(M\\) (if feeling brave!)\nNow estimate steepness, h (h may hit an unrealistic bound, i.e., 0.2 or 1 - if the data are in conflict so be wary)\nNow estimate the other annual deviations (e.g., annual deviations on kappa or age-year deviations on selectivity).\nFinally environmental linkages, e.g., between recruitment and an environmental variable such as temperature.\n\n\n\nOther ways of tackling phases (per Jason Cope)\n\nStart life history parameters (growth and sometimes mortality) estimation in phase 3 or even phase 2.\nLeave selectivity until phases 3 or 4 (after life history) IF you have decent starting values for selectivity already.\n\n\n\nSome additional notes (per Rick Methot)\n\nBe careful with many phases unless you have good initial values for the un-estimated parameters.\nParameters with high correlation usually should be estimated in the same phase, so ADMB can change them in sync.\nExamine your composition data patterns before deciding to estimate recruitment deviations or time-varying selectivity first."

We assume that these users have had previous population dynamics modeling experience and already understand how to run an existing SS3 model.\nIf you are a new SS3 user who is not yet comfortable running an SS3 model, we suggest trying to run a working example model using advice in the Getting Started document before attempting to develop and run your own model as outlined in this guide. You can also get more general model building advice in the Developing your first Stock Synthesis model guide.\nThroughout this example, we use an even simpler version of the Stock Synthesis example model “Simple”. To get the most out of this tutorial, it is best to download the model files to look at during the tutorial. It may also be useful to run the model and plot the results using the R package {r4ss}."

Full selectivity was assumed for age-0 fish only (i.e., the survey does not catch any fish older than age 0) for the second survey. Catchability (Q) is estimated for both surveys, and to adjust for data quality, additional standard deviation is specified.\nCatch comes from the fishery.

    "text": "Data file\nThis is where the data inputs are specified. At the top, general information about the model is specified: the model years, number of seasons, number of sexes, maximum age, number of areas, number of fleets:\n\n#Stock Synthesis (SS3) is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.\n#Foreign copyrights may apply. See copyright.txt for more information.\n1971 #_StartYr\n2001 #_EndYr\n1 #_Nseas\n12 #_months/season\n2 #_Nsubseasons (even number, minimum is 2)\n1 #_spawn_month\n2 #_Nsexes: 1, 2, -1  (use -1 for 1 sex setup with SSB multiplied by female_frac parameter)\n40 #_Nages=accumulator age, first age is always age 0\n1 #_Nareas\n3 #_Nfleets (including surveys)\n\nNext, the fleet types are specified. Since we have one fishery and 2 surveys (3 fleets in all), there will be three lines.\n\n#_fleet_type: 1=catch fleet; 2=bycatch only fleet; 3=survey; 4=ignore \n#_sample_timing: -1 for fishing fleet to use season-long catch-at-age for observations, or 1 to use observation month;  (always 1 for surveys)\n#_fleet_area:  area the fleet/survey operates in \n#_units of catch:  1=bio; 2=num (ignored for surveys; their units read later)\n#_catch_mult: 0=no; 1=yes\n#_rows are fleets\n#_fleet_type fishery_timing area catch_units need_catch_mult fleetname\n 1 -1 1 1 0 FISHERY  # 1\n 3 1 1 2 0 SURVEY1  # 2\n 3 1 1 2 0 SURVEY2  # 3\n\nMost notable in these fleet types is that the fishery has type 1 (because it is a catch fleet) and the surveys have type 3. Units for each fleet (what is called “catch units” in the header) are also specified in this part of the data file, although for the surveys they are ignored. For the fishery, it has “catch-units” = 1, which means it is in units of biomass and not numbers.The names for the fleets are specified last on each line (before the comment). For example, in this case, the fishery has been named FISHERY, while the first survey has been named SURVEY1.\nNext, the catch is specified:\n\n#_Catch data: yr, seas, fleet, catch, catch_se\n#_catch_se:  standard error of log(catch)\n#_NOTE:  catch data is ignored for survey fleets\n-999 1 1 0 0.01\n1971 1 1 0 0.01\n1972 1 1 200 0.01\n1973 1 1 1000 0.01\n...\n...\n...\n2000 1 1 3000 0.01\n2001 1 1 3000 0.01\n-9999 0 0 0 0\n\nThe first line of the above code chunk shows the column headers for the catch data. Note that all catch comes from the fishery. The line -999 1 1 0 0.01 specifies equilibirum catch for years before the model starts - in this case, there is no equilibrium catch because the catch column is 0. To terminate this catch data section the line -9999 0 0 0 0 is needed. This tells SS3 that it can stop reading catch data.\nNext comes specification for indices of abundance. First is the setup for all of the fleets:\n\n#_CPUE_and_surveyabundance_observations\n#_Units:  0=numbers; 1=biomass; 2=F; &gt;=30 for special types\n#_Errtype:  -1=normal; 0=lognormal; &gt;0=T\n#_SD_Report: 0=no sdreport; 1=enable sdreport\n#_Fleet Units Errtype SD_Report\n1 1 0 0 # FISHERY\n2 1 0 1 # SURVEY1\n3 0 0 0 # SURVEY2\n\nThe column headers for this section are directly above the numbers. Note that all fleets are defined in this section (i.e., each fleet needs a line), including the fishery and are listed in the same order as when the fleet types were specified. Most importantly in this section, the units and error type that will be used when reading the the indices of abundance are specified. In this case, the fishery and survey 1 have units of biomass, whereas survey 2 is in numbers. Log-normal error is assumed for all 3 of the fleets.\nDirectly after its header, the indices of abundance data is included:\n\n#_yr month fleet obs stderr\n1977 7 2 339689 0.3 #_ SURVEY1\n1980 7 2 193353 0.3 #_ SURVEY1\n1983 7 2 151984 0.3 #_ SURVEY1\n...\n...\n...\n2000 7 3 5.97125 0.7 #_ SURVEY2\n2001 7 3 1.69379 0.7 #_ SURVEY2\n-9999 1 1 1 1 # terminator for survey observations \n\nLike the catch data, a terminator line is needed to tell SS3 when to stop reading the indices.\nNext, discards and mean body size data could be specified, but they are 0 in this example:\n\n0 #_N_fleets_with_discard\n...\n...\n...\n0 #_use meanbodysize_data (0/1)\n\nThe next section sets up the population length bins. This needs to be specified whether or not length composition data is used (although you could generate the population length bins from the length composition data bins).\n\n# set up population length bin structure (note - irrelevant if not using size data and using empirical wtatage\n2 # length bin method: 1=use databins; 2=generate from binwidth,min,max below; 3=read vector\n2 # binwidth for population size comp \n10 # minimum size in the population (lower edge of first bin and size at age 0.00) \n94 # maximum size in the population (lower edge of last bin) \n1 # use length composition data (0/1)\n\nFollowing the population bins is the setup for length composition (expecting 1 line per fleet):\n\n#_mintailcomp addtocomp combM+F CompressBins CompError ParmSelect minsamplesize\n0 1e-007 0 0 0 0 1 #_fleet:1_FISHERY\n0 1e-007 0 0 0 0 1 #_fleet:2_SURVEY1\n0 1e-007 0 0 0 0 1 #_fleet:3_SURVEY2\n\nThe length composition bin setup:\n\n25 #_N_LengthBins; then enter lower edge of each length bin\n 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 68 72 76 80 90\n\nAnd then the length composition data:\n\n#_yr month fleet sex part Nsamp datavector(female-male)\n 1971 7 1 3 0 125 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 1 2 4 1 5 6 2 3 11 8 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 3 0 3 4 2 4 5 9 17 8 3 8 0 0\n 1972 7 1 3 0 125 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 2 1 1 6 2 7 4 10 10 4 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 4 1 3 1 4 4 7 3 8 11 4 10 0 0\n 1973 7 1 3 0 125 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 4 5 6 3 10 12 6 10 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 3 0 7 2 6 7 8 5 5 3 0\n 1974 7 1 3 0 125 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 1 1 1 4 5 3 8 8 10 4 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 4 0 0 1 5 6 6 4 6 15 11 5 0 3 0\n ...\n ...\n ...\n 1998 7 2 3 0 125 0 0 0 3 1 1 2 3 4 6 4 6 5 3 1 2 1 1 1 5 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 5 4 2 3 7 2 1 4 4 5 3 2 3 1 8 6 2 0 0 0\n 2001 7 2 3 0 125 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 5 7 5 9 2 9 5 4 4 1 1 2 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 4 6 5 6 4 3 4 4 5 1 3 2 1 3 2 0 0 0 0\n-9999 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n\nIn this 2 sex model, length composition data is put in for females, with 1 number per length composition bin set up previously, followed by data for males with also 1 number per length composition bin.\nAge composition data follows. First, the age bins and ageerror definitions are established:\n\n17 #_N_age_bins\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 20 25\n1 #_N_ageerror_definitions\n 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 9.5 10.5 11.5 12.5 13.5 14.5 15.5 16.5 17.5 18.5 19.5 20.5 21.5 22.5 23.5 24.5 25.5 26.5 27.5 28.5 29.5 30.5 31.5 32.5 33.5 34.5 35.5 36.5 37.5 38.5 39.5 40.5\n 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001\n\nFor the age bins, SS3 reads in the number (17 in this case) and then expects that number of inputs for the age bins (the 17 values below it). Next, SS3 reads the age error definitions. In this case, there is only 1 definition, so SS3 expects 2 vectors, each which contain the max number of ages + 1 values (41 values per vector in this case). The first line defines the bias for the aging error, while the second vector defines the standard deviation of the aging error. This example has no aging bias and very high aging precision (low standard deviation), so this is close to assuming no aging error.\nNext comes the age composition setup lines:\n\n#_mintailcomp addtocomp combM+F CompressBins CompError ParmSelect minsamplesize\n0 1e-007 1 0 0 0 1 #_fleet:1_FISHERY\n0 1e-007 1 0 0 0 1 #_fleet:2_SURVEY1\n0 1e-007 1 0 0 0 1 #_fleet:3_SURVEY2\n1 #_Lbin_method_for_Age_Data: 1=poplenbins; 2=datalenbins; 3=lengths\n\nwhich includes the length bin method for ages. Finally, the age composition data is input:\n\n#_yr month fleet sex part ageerr Lbin_lo Lbin_hi Nsamp datavector(female-male)\n 1971 7 1 3 0 1 -1 -1 75 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 4 2 1 0 1 2 2 13 2 3 0 0 4 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 6 5 8\n 1972 7 1 3 0 1 -1 -1 75 2 1 1 1 0 3 1 2 2 5 3 1 2 2 9 8 3 0 0 1 2 3 1 3 0 5 1 3 0 2 1 2 3 2\n 1973 7 1 3 0 1 -1 -1 75 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 3 3 1 1 5 2 2 7 4 3 0 0 0 4 1 3 5 1 2 3 1 3 2 0 5 3 6\n ...\n ...\n ...\n 1998 7 2 3 0 1 -1 -1 75 9 4 4 3 1 1 1 1 3 3 1 2 1 7 0 0 0 0 6 5 3 5 1 3 3 2 3 2 0 1 0 0 0 0\n 2001 7 2 3 0 1 -1 -1 75 4 0 4 11 5 3 4 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 4 7 11 5 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 1 0 0\n-9999 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOne important note is that using Lbin_lo and Lbin_hi = -1 selects the entire length bin as being used for the ages. Similar to the length composition data, SS3 expect 1 value for females in each data bin, followed by values for males in each data bin (in this case, there are 34 values in the data vector)\nSS3 has some additional options that we have not used in this setup and thus set to 0:\n\n0 #_Use_MeanSize-at-Age_obs (0/1)\n#\n0 #_N_environ_variables\n#Yr Variable Value\n#\n0 # N sizefreq methods to read \n#\n0 # do tags (0/1)\n#\n0 #    morphcomp data(0/1) \n#  Nobs, Nmorphs, mincomp\n#  yr, seas, type, partition, Nsamp, datavector_by_Nmorphs\n#\n0  #  Do dataread for selectivity priors(0/1)\n\nAnd finally, the data file must end in 999 to tell SS3 to stop reading.\n\n999"

The first option to be aware of is a line to read the empirical weight at age file:\n\n0  # 0 means do not read wtatage.ss; 1 means read and use wtatage.ss and also read and use growth parameters\n\nIn this case, it is not being used, so is set to 0. If empirical weight-at-age were used, SS3 would ignore all inputs relating to growth, maturity, and fecundity that are specified later in the control file (although it does still expect inputs).\nNext are options for number of growth patterns and platoons. These are set to 1 because we assume the whole population is the same growth pattern, and there are not platoons within the growth patterns.\n\n1  #_N_Growth_Patterns (Growth Patterns, Morphs, Bio Patterns, GP are terms used interchangeably in SS)\n1 #_N_platoons_Within_GrowthPattern \n\nThe recruitment distribution is then specified. We are assuming for this population that there is only 1 growth pattern, 1 time of settlement, and 1 area, so we can use option 4. This is the simplest, because it requires no full parameter lines further on in the control file.\n\n#\n4 # recr_dist_method for parameters:  2=main effects for GP, Area, Settle timing; 3=each Settle entity; 4=none (only when N_GP*Nsettle*pop==1)\n1 # not yet implemented; Future usage: Spawner-Recruitment: 1=global; 2=by area\n1 #  number of recruitment settlement assignments \n0 # unused option\n#GPattern month  area  age (for each settlement assignment)\n 1 1 1 0\n#\n\nNote that we also used 1 settlement assignment, and specified that the fish settled in January at age 0.

The parameters must also be specified in a particular order, with female parameters coming before male parameters in a 2-sex model:\n\n#_ LO HI INIT PRIOR PR_SD PR_type PHASE env_var&link dev_link dev_minyr dev_maxyr dev_PH Block Block_Fxn\n# Sex: 1  BioPattern: 1  NatMort\n 0.05 0.15 0.1 0.1 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1\n# Sex: 1  BioPattern: 1  Growth\n -10 45 21.6535 36 10 6 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # L_at_Amin_Fem_GP_1\n 40 90 71.6493 70 10 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1\n 0.05 0.25 0.147297 0.15 0.8 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1\n 0.05 0.25 0.1 0.1 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # CV_young_Fem_GP_1\n 0.05 0.25 0.1 0.1 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # CV_old_Fem_GP_1\n# Sex: 1  BioPattern: 1  WtLen\n -3 3 2.44e-006 2.44e-006 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # Wtlen_1_Fem_GP_1\n -3 4 3.34694 3.34694 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # Wtlen_2_Fem_GP_1\n# Sex: 1  BioPattern: 1  Maturity&Fecundity\n 50 60 55 55 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # Mat50%_Fem_GP_1\n -3 3 -0.25 -0.25 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # Mat_slope_Fem_GP_1\n -3 3 1 1 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # Eggs/kg_inter_Fem_GP_1\n -3 3 0 0 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # Eggs/kg_slope_wt_Fem_GP_1\n# Sex: 2  BioPattern: 1  NatMort\n 0.05 0.15 0.1 0.1 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # NatM_p_1_Mal_GP_1\n# Sex: 2  BioPattern: 1  Growth\n 1 45 0 36 10 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # L_at_Amin_Mal_GP_1\n 40 90 69.5362 70 10 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # L_at_Amax_Mal_GP_1\n 0.05 0.25 0.163533 0.15 0.8 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1\n 0.05 0.25 0.1 0.1 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # CV_young_Mal_GP_1\n 0.05 0.25 0.1 0.1 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # CV_old_Mal_GP_1\n# Sex: 2  BioPattern: 1  WtLen\n -3 3 2.44e-006 2.44e-006 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # Wtlen_1_Mal_GP_1\n -3 4 3.34694 3.34694 0.8 0 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # Wtlen_2_Mal_GP_1\n# Hermaphroditism\n#  Recruitment Distribution  \n#  Cohort growth dev base\n 0.1 10 1 1 1 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # CohortGrowDev\n#  Movement\n#  Age Error from parameters\n#  catch multiplier\n#  fraction female, by GP\n 1e-006 0.999999 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 -99 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 # FracFemale_GP_1\n\nNote that the first line in the block of SS3 input above shows the column headers. All sections with long parameter lines within the control file have these same headings. There are a lot of specifications in these long parameter lines, but a few of particular note are:\n\nAnything with negative phase (7th value in a long parameter line) is not estimated and is set at the initial value (3rd value in the line), while positive phases are estimated.\nNatural mortality for both males and females is specified at 0.1.\nThe 3 parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth curve are estimated.\n\nNext are some unused options, because there is no seasonality in the biology parameters:\n\n#_no timevary MG parameters\n#\n#_seasonal_effects_on_biology_parms\n 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 #_femwtlen1,femwtlen2,mat1,mat2,fec1,fec2,Malewtlen1,malewtlen2,L1,K\n#_ LO HI INIT PRIOR PR_SD PR_type PHASE\n#_Cond -2 2 0 0 -1 99 -2 #_placeholder when no seasonal MG parameters\n\nNext, the Spawner recruitment setup and Spawner recruit long parameter lines are specified (sometimes referred to as SR parms). To set up the lines, a Beverton-Holt SR curve is specified:\n\n3 #_Spawner-Recruitment; Options: 2=Ricker; 3=std_B-H; 4=SCAA; 5=Hockey; 6=B-H_flattop; 7=survival_3Parm; 8=Shepherd_3Parm; 9=RickerPower_3parm\n0  # 0/1 to use steepness in initial equ recruitment calculation\n0  #  future feature:  0/1 to make realized sigmaR a function of SR curvature\n\nwhich effects the number of SR parameter lines that follow:\n\n#_          LO            HI          INIT         PRIOR         PR_SD       PR_type      PHASE    env-var    use_dev   dev_mnyr   dev_mxyr     dev_PH      Block    Blk_Fxn #  parm_name\n             3            31       8.81505          10.3            10             0          1          0          0          0          0          0          0          0 # SR_LN(R0)\n           0.2             1      0.614248           0.7          0.05             1          4          0          0          0          0          0          0          0 # SR_BH_steep\n             0             2           0.6           0.8           0.8             0         -4          0          0          0          0          0          0          0 # SR_sigmaR\n            -5             5             0             0             1             0         -4          0          0          0          0          0          0          0 # SR_regime\n             0             0             0             0             0             0        -99          0          0          0          0          0          0          0 # SR_autocorr\n\nThe recruitment deviation options are specified after the SR parms. First are the standard recruitment deviations options:\n\n1 #do_recdev:  0=none; 1=devvector (R=F(SSB)+dev); 2=deviations (R=F(SSB)+dev); 3=deviations (R=R0*dev; dev2=R-f(SSB)); 4=like 3 with sum(dev2) adding penalty\n1971 # first year of main recr_devs; early devs can preceed this era\n2001 # last year of main recr_devs; forecast devs start in following year\n2 #_recdev phase \n\nThese define the main recruitment deviations, which in this case last from the first year of the model to the last year. Advanced options are also read:\n\n1 # (0/1) to read 13 advanced options\n 0 #_recdev_early_start (0=none; neg value makes relative to recdev_start)\n -4 #_recdev_early_phase\n 0 #_forecast_recruitment phase (incl. late recr) (0 value resets to maxphase+1)\n 1 #_lambda for Fcast_recr_like occurring before endyr+1\n 1900 #_last_yr_nobias_adj_in_MPD; begin of ramp\n 1900 #_first_yr_fullbias_adj_in_MPD; begin of plateau\n 2001 #_last_yr_fullbias_adj_in_MPD\n 2002 #_end_yr_for_ramp_in_MPD (can be in forecast to shape ramp, but SS3 sets bias_adj to 0.0 for fcast yrs)\n 1 #_max_bias_adj_in_MPD (-1 to override ramp and set biasadj=1.0 for all estimated recdevs)\n 0 #_period of cycles in recruitment (N parms read below)\n -5 #min rec_dev\n 5 #max rec_dev\n 0 #_read_recdevs\n#_end of advanced SR options\n\nThe advanced options allow the user to bias adjust the recruitment deviations. There is more on bias adjustment in the SS3 user manual, but the general idea is to account for the fact that earlier and later recruitment deviations likely have less information informing them than the ones in the middle. The bias adjustment ramp accounts for this and is typically “tuned” by looking at bias ramp in the model results after it is run, re-specifying the bias ramp as needed, and rerunning the model.\nFishing mortality info is next specified:\n\n#Fishing Mortality info \n0.3 # F ballpark\n-2001 # F ballpark year (neg value to disable)\n3 # F_Method:  1=Pope; 2=instan. F; 3=hybrid (hybrid is recommended)\n2.95 # max F or harvest rate, depends on F_Method\n# no additional F input needed for Fmethod 1\n# if Fmethod=2; read overall start F value; overall phase; N detailed inputs to read\n# if Fmethod=3; read N iterations for tuning for Fmethod 3\n4  # N iterations for tuning F in hybrid method (recommend 3 to 7)\n\nThere are no particular special settings for fishing mortality information for this model, but note that the recommended hybrid \\(F\\) method is used.\nCatchability setup and parameter lines follow fishing mortality info:\n\n#_Q_setup for fleets with cpue or survey data\n#_1:  fleet number\n#_2:  link type: (1=simple q, 1 parm; 2=mirror simple q, 1 mirrored parm; 3=q and power, 2 parm; 4=mirror with offset, 2 parm)\n#_3:  extra input for link, i.e. mirror fleet# or dev index number\n#_4:  0/1 to select extra sd parameter\n#_5:  0/1 for biasadj or not\n#_6:  0/1 to float\n#_   fleet      link link_info  extra_se   biasadj     float  #  fleetname\n         2         1         0         1         0         0  #  SURVEY1\n         3         1         0         0         0         0  #  SURVEY2\n-9999 0 0 0 0 0\n#\n#_Q_parms(if_any);Qunits_are_ln(q)\n#_ LO HI INIT PRIOR PR_SD PR_type PHASE env-var use_dev dev_mnyr dev_mxyr dev_PH Block Blk_Fxn # parm_name\n   -7 5   0.516018 0    1 0  1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  #  LnQ_base_SURVEY1(2)\n    0 0.5 0        0.05 1 0 -4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  #  Q_extraSD_SURVEY1(2)\n   -7 5   -6.6281  0    1 0  1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  #  LnQ_base_SURVEY2(3)\n\nBecause the fishery is not used as an index of abundance, it does not require any catchability setup lines or parameters. Note that the log scale (LNQ) catchability parameters are both estimated for the surveys. Also, for fleet 2 in the setup lines, it was specified to used extra standard error, so there is an extraSD fixed value specified as a parameter line.\nSelectivity comes next. First, the size and age selectivity setup lines:\n\n#_size_selex_patterns\n...\n...\n...\n#_Pattern Discard Male Special\n 1 0 0 0 # 1 FISHERY\n 1 0 0 0 # 2 SURVEY1\n 0 0 0 0 # 3 SURVEY2\n #\n#_age_selex_patterns\n ...\n ...\n ...\n #_Pattern Discard Male Special\n 11 0 0 0 # 1 FISHERY\n 11 0 0 0 # 2 SURVEY1\n 11 0 0 0 # 3 SURVEY2\n\nA selectivity pattern must be specified for both size and age selectivity for each fleet; however, using patterns 0 and 1 for size selectivity allow the user to specify that selectivity is the same across all sizes (within the range specified, if using pattern 1). In this setup, age selectivity pattern 11 (logistic) is used for all of the fleets. The selectivity setup lines are followed by the selectivity parameter lines:\n\n#_          LO            HI          INIT         PRIOR         PR_SD       PR_type      PHASE    env-var    use_dev   dev_mnyr   dev_mxyr     dev_PH      Block    Blk_Fxn  #  parm_name\n# 1   FISHERY LenSelex\n            19            80       53.6411            50          0.01             1          2          0          0          0          0          0          0          0  #  Size_inflection_FISHERY(1)\n          0.01            60       18.9232            15          0.01             1          3          0          0          0          0          0          0          0  #  Size_95%width_FISHERY(1)\n# 2   SURVEY1 LenSelex\n            19            70        36.653            30          0.01             1          2          0          0          0          0          0          0          0  #  Size_inflection_SURVEY1(2)\n          0.01            60       6.59179            10          0.01             1          3          0          0          0          0          0          0          0  #  Size_95%width_SURVEY1(2)\n# 3   SURVEY2 LenSelex\n# 1   FISHERY AgeSelex\n             0            40             0             5            99             0         -1          0          0          0          0          0          0          0  #  minage@sel=1_FISHERY(1)\n             0            40            40             6            99             0         -1          0          0          0          0          0          0          0  #  maxage@sel=1_FISHERY(1)\n# 2   SURVEY1 AgeSelex\n             0            40             0             5            99             0         -1          0          0          0          0          0          0          0  #  minage@sel=1_SURVEY1(2)\n             0            40            40             6            99             0         -1          0          0          0          0          0          0          0  #  maxage@sel=1_SURVEY1(2)\n# 3   SURVEY2 AgeSelex\n             0            40             0             5            99             0         -1          0          0          0          0          0          0          0  #  minage@sel=1_SURVEY2(3)\n             0            40             0             6            99             0         -1          0          0          0          0          0          0          0  #  maxage@sel=1_SURVEY2(3)\n#_no timevary selex parameters\n#\n\nThese parameter lines are specified in order, with the size (or length) selectivity lines specified before the age selectivity lines and the fleets in the same order as in the setup lines. Also, the selectivity pattern used determines the number of parameters needed to specify each fleets’ size or age selectivity.\nSome special features (2DAR selectivity, tagging data, variance adjustment, lambdas, and additional standard deviation reporting) in the control file are turned off for this model:\n\n0   #  use 2D_AR1 selectivity(0/1):  experimental feature\n#_no 2D_AR1 selex offset used\n#\n# Tag loss and Tag reporting parameters go next\n0  # TG_custom:  0=no read and autogen if tag data exist; 1=read\n...\n# Input variance adjustments factors: \n...\n#_Factor  Fleet  Value\n -9999   1    0  # terminator\n#\n4 #_maxlambdaphase\n1 #_sd_offset; must be 1 if any growthCV, sigmaR, or survey extraSD is an estimated parameter\n...\n#like_comp fleet  phase  value  sizefreq_method\n-9999  1  1  1  1  #  terminator\n#\n0 # (0/1) read specs for more stddev reporting \n\nVariance adjustment factors and/or lambdas can be used for data weighting, but in this case they have not yet been used. The control file then ends with 999 so that SS3 knows it can stop reading:\n\n999"

In this case, the final gradient is smaller than the convergence criteria, so this suggests (but does not guarantee) that the model has converged.\nWe also want to check that there are no estimated parameters on bounds, which can also be done in the Report.sso file. Further down in Report.sso (around line 272), should be a line that tells how many active (i.e., estimated) parameters were on bounds:\n\nNumber_of_active_parameters_on_or_near_bounds: 0\nActive_count 54\n\nIf there were any parameters on bounds, the analyst would need to decide if the bounds on the parameter are appropriate or not and consider expanding the bounds or fixing the parameter (if there is not enough information informing the parameter estimate, fixing it may be necessary)."

    "text": "Further convergence check: Jitter the start values\nA common method to have even more confidence that the model has converged is to jitter (i.e., change slightly) the starting values in the model. The {r4ss} function SS_RunJitter() can be used to easily do this.\nTo jitter a mondel, first the amount of jitter and the option to use the .par file should be set in the starter.ss file. Typically, 0.01 is used:\n\n0.1 # jitter initial parm value by this fraction\n\nand option to read the par file in the starter file is set to 1:\n\n1 # 0=use init values in control file; 1=use ss3.par\n\nUsing the .par file from a previous run is useful because starting the model from previous values will speed up the runs.\nThe starter file values can be modified by opening up the starter.ss file and modifying it by hand, or {r4ss} functions can be used to change this within R, as shown in this example from {r4ss}:\n\nlibrary(r4ss)\nstarter &lt;- SS_readstarter(file.path(mydir, 'starter.ss'))\nstarter$init_values_src = 1 # Change to use .par file\n# Change jitter (0.1 is an arbitrary, but common choice for jitter amount)\nstarter$jitter_fraction = 0.1\nSS_writestarter(starter, dir = mydir, overwrite = TRUE) # write modified starter file\n\nNext, the jitter can be run:\n\nSS_RunJitter(mydir = \"simpler\", model = \"ss3\", Njitter = 100)\n\nThe previous code assumes that the model directory mydir is called “simpler”, which is a folder within the working directory. The model argument specifies the name of the ss3 executable, so in this case, it assumes that the SS3 executable is within the “simpler” folder and called “ss3.exe”. Finally, Njitter tells the function how many times to run the function. For west coast stock assessment jitters, 100 runs is a common value to use, but note that the run time is not trivial (it depends on the model, but may take an hour or more to run).\nAfter the jitter is run, the final likelihood values are the most important part of the results to look at. If the original model run has found a global minimum, you would expect all likelihood values from the jitter to be the same or higher than the original model run. If there are any likelihood values that are lower than the original model run, this indicates that the model run did not find a global minimum. Investigating the run or runs with lower likelihood values would be the next step in figuring out what the “final” model run will be.\nTo check on the results of the jitter, code similar to this example code from {r4ss} can be used:\n\n #### Read in results using other r4ss functions\n profilemodels &lt;- SSgetoutput(dirvec = \"simpler\", keyvec=1:100, getcovar=FALSE)\n # summarize output\n profilesummary &lt;- SSsummarize(profilemodels)\n profilesummary$likelihoods[1,]  # Likelihoods\n profilesummary$pars # Parameters"

They appear in 1978 as age 0 fish because their settlement month (1.0) is earlier than their spawning month (12.0), so settlement must be in the year following spawning.\nSS3 produces this note in warnings.sso:\n#| code-overflow: wrap\nNote 3 Information: settle_month is less than spawn_month, so logical age at settlement calculated to be: 1 for settle_time 1 does not match read value of 0 are you sure?\nSwitching settlement age to 1 resolves the warning and now the fish first appear in the NAA table as age 1 fish in 1978. Age 0 fish never appear in the NAA table with this configuration.\n\n\n\nExample 2: January spawning, January settlement\nShift spawning to occur on January 1 and virtual recruitment at the same time, 1.0. Spawning biomass is higher on January 1 of 1977 than December 1 of 1977, as a result the recruitment is higher (note that the model was not re-estimated to allow for \\(ln(R_{0})\\) to come into alignment with the spawn month).\nYr SpawnBio exp_recr with_regime bias_adjusted pred_recr dev\n1977 80997  9935.39 9935.39 8298.73 61319.8 2.0 \nThese fish appear in the NAA table in 1977, not 1978 because the settlement date (1.0) is not smaller than the spawning date (also 1.0).\n\n\nExample 3: January spawning, March settlement\nSpawning on January 1 and settlement on March 1 (month 3.0).\nSpawn_recr table shows recruits in 1977 as 61328.1. Which will be 30664.05 per sex.\nThese fish appear in the NAA table in 1977 at age 0. They have elevated numbers (31179.4) because the table contains their numbers at the beginning of the season inflated by \\(exp(M*deltaT)\\), whereas \\(ln(R_{0})\\) references their numbers at the time of settlement, which is 2 months later.\n\n\nExample 4: March spawning\nSpawning on March 1 and settlement on March 15 at age 0.\nThis is an non-allowed configuration because the recruits must be backed up to the beginning of the season (January 1) where they potentially could be part of the spawning biomass of March 1 that produced them.\nSS3 produces this warning:\nWarning 1 Fatal Error! Cannot have spawn_time_seas after beginning of a season and settlements in the same season.  Put spawning at beginning of the season, or move settlements to next season\nSpawning on Mar 1 and settlement on Feb 1  at age 0.  \nNote 3 Information: settle_month is less than spawn_month, so logical age at settlement calculated to be: 1  for settle_time 1.  Does not match read value of 0 are you sure? \nSpawning on Mar 1 and settlement on Feb 1  at age 1.  No warning is produced.  The big yearclass shows up in NAA at age 1 in 1978.\n\n\nExample 5: February spawning, May settlement (OK if split across seasons)\nSpawning on February 1 and settlement on May 1 at age 0, with 2 seasons (January-March, April-December). This is legal because the May 1 settlement now is just backed up to April 1 which is after the spawning event that occurred in the previous season.\n\n\nExample 6: February spawn, January settle of following year at age 1\nIn this example, the big 1977 recruitment will show up in the NAA table at age 1 in the following year, 1978.\nIf spawning had been set to month 1.0, then SS3 would allow the Jan 1 settlement at age 1 to occur in 1977 also. This is a year off and illogical.\nHowever, with spawning at month 1.0, settlement at month 13.0, and settlement age at 1.0, then the big recruitment correctly shows up in 1978 at age 1. So, it is critical to think about the timing of spawning relative to settlement and to check results in the NAA table."

    "text": "Example Set-ups\n\nExample set-up 1\nA single recruitment event is now split among 3 events happening in April, May and June; all with the same growth parameters. Previously, the data indicated that the CV of length-at-age for young fish was rather larger. But that conclusion was linked to the assumption that all the recruits were exactly the same age. In the revised setup, the recruits now have a spread of age since settlement, so at a point in time they will have a spread of lengths. Consequently, it is expected that the CV parameter for young fish can be less when recruits are distributed among a spread of temporal settlement events.\n\n\nExample set-up 2\nSpawning is in October and recruitment occurs with two settlement events. One settlement is in December and the settlement age is 0. The other settlement is in February and the settlement age is 1. The first settlement will graduate to age 1 on January 1, so by February when the second settlement occurs, they both will appear as the same integer age.\nThe total number of recruits is scaled by the parameter \\(ln(R_{0})\\). Even when this total is divided among morphs, sexes, and settlement events at different times, the total of all those settlement events will be equal to \\(exp(ln(R_{0}))\\). However, settlers are always added at the beginning of a season because they will experience mortality throughout the season. This means that when a settlement event happens not at the beginning of a season, its initial numbers are adjusted upwards such that after in-season mortality occurs its numbers at the assigned time of settlement will be correct. This is a benign process if only natural mortality is acting on the pre-settlement fish. However, if fishing mortality is also active, then it would be better to create more seasons such that the settlement event could then occur at the beginning of a season and have its fishing mortality more explicitly under control.\nFor the purpose of growth calculation, fish have a real_age of 0.0 at the time of settlement, so each settlement timing has a unique starting point for real_age, unlike calendar_age which is relative to January 1 of the spawn year. All fish graduate to the next integer age on January 1. Real_age is used as the basis for growth, and for some types of age-specific natural mortality. This means that when fish of the same growth pattern are distributed among more than one settlement timing, the early born fish have a head start in the growth process, but since they are all growing towards the same maximum size, they gradually converge in growth. Conceptually, the time between spawning and settlement is a larval phase that is post spawner-recruitment and pre-settlement. They are in a planktonic limbo until settling. Where, when, and what growth type they have upon settlement is controlled by the recruitment distribution. Then upon settling, the juvenile fish begin growing according to adult growth parameters and enter exposure to explicit natural and fishing mortality.\nGrowth - Fish begin growing according to the growth curve when they reach the real_age equal to the user-assigned quantity, \\(A_{min}\\). At the \\(real\\_age = Amin\\), fish have the mean body length of \\(L_{min}\\). \\(A_{min}\\) is in terms of real_age post-settlement, not calendar_age post January 1 of the spawning year. \\(A_{min}\\) can have a value of 0.0, especially if the time of settlement is several months post-spawning. If \\(A_{min}\\) is &gt;0.0, then size-at-age of fish is assigned according to a linearly interpolated fraction of \\(L_{min}\\). If you are using age-specific \\(K\\), then the integer age measured starting from the spawn year is used to select an age-specific \\(K\\) change.\nGrowth parameters - If you have growth parameters calculated externally to SS3, they probably are relative to age being measured in terms of calendar age, not real-age post settlement. The growth \\(K\\) and \\(L_{max}\\) parameters will be unaffected, but \\(L_{min}\\) very much depends on the shifting along the age axis."

The one folder approach is the simplest way to run SS3 via the command line, so we will walk through an example run using this approach.\n\nSetup for the 1 folder approach\nCreate a folder and add:\n\nControl File (Must match name in starter.ss)\nData File (Must match name in starter.ss)\nforecast.ss\nss3.exe\nstarter.ss\nConditional files: wtatage.ss (if doing empirical wt-at-age approach) and/or ss3.par (to continue from a previous run)\n\nFor example, the following image shows what should be included for a model with no conditional files (where the control and data file names specified in starter.ss are control.ss and data.ss, respectively):\n\n\n\nRun SS3\nOnce all of the model files and the SS3 executable are in the same folder, you can open your command window of choice at the location of the model files.\nTo do this, you can typically click to highlight the folder the model files are in, then shift + right click on the same folder and select the option from the menu to open the command line of choice (e.g., Windows Powershell). This should bring up a command window. Then, type ss3 (or other name of the ss3 exe) into the command prompt and hit enter. Note that if you are using Windows Powershell, you will need to type ./ss3.\nThe exact instructions for running SS3 can differ depending on the command window used. If you have trouble, search for resources that describe running an executable for your specific command line.\nIf you still have issues, double-check that you are calling the correct exe name (e.g., you would need to type ss3_win to run an executable called ss3_win.exe.) and that the command line has the correct directory.\nAfter starting the run, you should see output to the command line similar to:\n\nIf the output gets past Estimating…please wait…, then the structure of the SS3 inputs is correct. The volume of information displayed during the run within the command window is controlled in starter.ss file on the line with the comment # run display detail (0,1,2). The 0 setting is the least verbose option, while the 2 setting is the most verbose.\nSS3 always opens and reads files in the same order (starter.ss, data file, forecast.ss, control, then wtatage.ss if using, and finally ss3.par if using), writing to echoinput.sso (a file for debugging runs) and warnings.sso (a file which collects warnings from SS3) as it reads. SS3 inputs are read in order by value, without reference to comments (i.e., anything after # on a line). Linebreaks and whitespace are both treated as separators. Depending on which options are selected, SS3 will expect a particular number of values in a certain order, so failing to provide them will result in errors or at least a different model specification than intended.\nAfter reading, SS3 proceeds immediately to pre-processing the data and creating internal parameter labels. As SS3 executes, it continues to write debugging output to echoinput.sso and warnings to warnings.sso.\nSS3 next goes to the procedure section where iterative parameter changes are made by ADMB to minimize the negative log likelihood. When ADMB achieves convergence, control passes to the sd_phase for calculation of parameter variance (unless –nohess option is specified; See command line options). After the sd_phase, SS3 proceeds to the benchmark and forecast code section and then to final reporting. Output files containing results are typically written to the directory in which the model was run from (except when using this special subfolder option).\nWhen the run completes, SS3 shows !! Run has completed !! and the number of warnings:\n Examine warnings.sso for issues and suggestions, regardless of if the run completed successfully or not. If SS3 exits on error, you will not see the message !! Run has completed !!. Below is an example of a run that exited on error due to invalid inputs:\n\n\n\nExamine the output\n.ss_new files are generated if a model run completes. For more information on the .ss_new files, see the “Output Files” section of the SS3 user manual.\nss_summary.sso files are included with the examples on vlab so that you can compare it with the ss_summary.sso file generated by your model run. You should see similar if not exactly the same values for the likelihood and parameter values if using the same version of SS3.\nOutput from SS3 can be read into {r4ss} or the excel viewer."

An ss3.par file is an output file created during each model run and contains the ending parameter values. Using this ss3.par file from a previous model run with a similar model (that still has the same parameters) will speed up run time because the initial values are likely closer to the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) parameter estimates."

If you suspect that historical catch reduced biomass below \\(B_{MSY}\\), then it is incorrect to use initial equilibrium approach. Instead, move start year earlier, and included the time series of catches that previously were averaged into the initial equilibrium catch. With this alternative, the time series of catches will be able to create \\(F\\)’s greater than \\(F_{MSY}\\). Also, what was a vector of initial age composition now appears in the model as a vector of recruitments extending further back in time.\n\nSubstantial changes in historical catch levels have occurred within a lifespan before start year\n\nIn this situation, the equilibrium assumption is violated.

    "text": "First year with recdevs\n\nBy starting rec_devs early (even long before influential data occur) the variability associated with \\(\\sigma R\\) creates variance in the population abundance and this variance can be seen in both recruitment and spawning biomass.\n\n\n\nThe first year with rec_devs (main or early) can be Nages before start year.\nDevs that occur long before the data do not influence the goodness of fit to the data, but the variance of those devs is still important to capture. Use of the early_devs concept is helpful in this situation because they can wait to be turned on in a late phase just to capture that variance.\nThe challenge with this long vector of devs is that the influence of data on the dev estimation gradually increases over time. So some of the devs may show unexpected patterns because of the influence of noise in the early data. Shortening up the number of years with devs may not help because the influence of the data is still there and the model response often will still show up in the first estimated dev.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of it as\n\n\n\nHow much of a logL improvement in fit to some early length comp sample is needed to outweigh the logL penalty caused by an early dev moving away from 0.0?"

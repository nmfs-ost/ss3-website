## Introduction

Stock Synthesis (SS3) is an age- and size-structured stock assessment model in the class of models termed integrated analysis. Stock Synthesis has evolved over time to be able to model a wide range of fish population dynamics and somatic growth and to utilize diverse types of data. The model is coded in C++ with parameter estimation enabled by automatic differentiation though AD Model Builder [ADMB](https://www.admb-project.org/) [@fournier2012].

SS3 is made up of

-   A population sub-model that simulates the following population processes:
    -   biology (growth, maturity, fecundity),
    -   recruitment,
    -   movement,
    -   fishery selectivity
    -   natural and fishing mortality, and
    -   responsiveness to environmental and predation factors.
-   An observation sub-model that estimates expected values for various types of data.
-   A statistical sub-model that characterizes the data's goodness of fit and obtains best-fitting parameters with associated variance.
-   A forecast sub-model that projects management quantities.

The equations behind the basic features of SS3 can be found in [Appendix A](https://sedarweb.org/documents/sedar-39-rd08-appendix-a-technical-description-of-the-stock-synthesis-assessment-program/) of @methot2013 ([link to PDF of paper](https://sedarweb.org/documents/sedar-39-rd07-stock-synthesis-a-biological-and-statistical-framework-for-fish-stock-assessment-and-fishery-management/)).

There are 100+ stocks in the US and throughout the world that use SS3 for which we have provided many national, international, and web-based trainings. Additionally, we have a very active user-base that contributes heavily to SS3 and the associated R packages as well as participates in the online discussions and forums. ![](qmds/images/ss3_map.png){width="90%" fig-alt="Image of a map showing where Stock Synthesis is used around the world and for which species."}

## Getting Started with Stock Synthesis {#sec-startSS3}

To get started with Stock Synthesis, please see the presentation below and the [Getting Started with Stock Synthesis Tutorial](qmds/getting_started_ss3.qmd):

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%", out.height= "400px", fig.alt="pdf of Getting Started presentation"}
knitr::include_graphics("SS3_Getting_Started.pdf")
```

### Getting Started Using the Stock Assessment Continuum Tool {#sec-startSAC}

If you are just getting started with Stock Synthesis, we highly recommend downloading the [Stock Assessment Continuum Tool](https://github.com/shcaba/SS-DL-tool), a shiny app (pictured below) where users can provide data and life-history information to create the Stock Synthesis input files, run the model, and produce plots and tables via the [{r4ss}](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) package. ![](qmds/images/stock_assess_continuation_tool.png){width="90%" fig-alt="Picture of the stock assessment continuum tool shiny app."}

### Getting Started Using the Input Files

To learn more about how to build your own models in Stock Synthesis using the input files directly, see the [Develop a Stock Synthesis model](qmds/ss3_model_tips.qmd) guide.

### Interacting with Stock Synthesis and Viewing Output Using {r4ss}

![](qmds/images/r4ss_logo.png){style="float: right;" fig-align="right" width="110" height="130" fig-alt="r4ss package hex logo"}

The [{r4ss}](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) package is a collection of R functions for interacting with Stock Synthesis. These functions include downloading the executable, changing model input, running the model, and creating an assortment of plots and tables. More information about using [{r4ss}](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) is available in the ["Introduction to r4ss"](https://r4ss.github.io/r4ss/articles/r4ss-intro-vignette.html) vignette. Furthermore, you can navigate to these [example plots](https://r4ss.github.io/r4ss/BigSkate) that were created using [{r4ss}](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) for the Big Skate model, which can be found in the [ss3-test-models](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-test-models) repository.

### User Example Models

We maintain a GitHub repository of [example stock synthesis models](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-user-examples) for users. Information on what the key features of the user example models are and how to download them can be found in the [SS3 user examples repository](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-user-examples#readme).
